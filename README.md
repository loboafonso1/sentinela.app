## Weekly Activity Progress

We implemented responsive, animated weekly progress bars:

- Component: `src/components/WeeklyBars.tsx`
  - Animated height with Framer Motion
  - Accessible (`role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`)
  - Responsive layout with flex
  - Graceful fallback when no data
- Integration: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` uses the component with `weeklyData`
- Data: `src/hooks/useMockData.ts` now provides 0–100 percentages
- Tests: `src/test/weeklybars.test.tsx` covers fallback and ARIA values

Success criteria:
- Visible in all sessions, auto-updates on state change
- Cross-browser compatible (CSS variables + framer-motion)
- Clear visual feedback via smooth animations
